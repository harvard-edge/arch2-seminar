Large language models (LLMs) have made headlines for synthesizing correct-sounding responses to a variety of prompts, including code generation. In this paper, we present the prompts used to guide ChatGPT4 to produce a synthesizable and functional verilog description for the entirety of a programmable Spiking Neuron Array ASIC. This design flow showcases the current state of using ChatGPT4 for natural language driven hardware design. The AI-generated design was verified in simulation using handcrafted testbenches and has been submitted for fabrication in Skywater 130nm through Tiny Tapeout 5 using an open-source EDA flow.
