This article is a short introduction to AI4OPT, the NSF AI Institute for Advances in Optimization. AI4OPT fuses AI and Optimization, inspired by end-use cases in supply chains, energy systems, chip design and manufacturing, and sustainable food systems. AI4OPT also applies its "teaching the teachers" philosophy to provide longitudinal educational pathways in AI for engineering.
