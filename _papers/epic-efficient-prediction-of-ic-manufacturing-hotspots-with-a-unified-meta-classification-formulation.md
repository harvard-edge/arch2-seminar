In this paper we present EPIC, an efficient and effective predictor for IC manufacturing hotspots in deep sub-wavelength lithography. EPIC proposes a unified framework to combine different hotspot detection methods together, such as machine learning and pattern matching, using mathematical programming/optimization. EPIC algorithm has been tested on a number of industry benchmarks under advanced manufacturing conditions. It demonstrates so far the best capability in selectively combining the desirable features of various hotspot detection methods (3.5-8.2% accuracy improvement) as well as significant suppression of the detection noise (e.g., 80% false-alarm reduction). These characteristics make EPIC very suitable for conducting high performance physical verification and guiding efficient manufacturability friendly physical design.
