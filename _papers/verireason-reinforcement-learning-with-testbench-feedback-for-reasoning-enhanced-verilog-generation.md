Automating Register Transfer Level (RTL) code generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) offers substantial promise for streamlining digital circuit design and reducing human effort. However, current LLM-based approaches face significant challenges with training data scarcity, poor specification-code alignment, lack of verification mechanisms, and balancing generalization with specialization. Inspired by DeepSeek-R1, we introduce VeriReason, a framework integrating supervised fine-tuning with Guided Reward Proximal Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning for RTL generation. Using curated training examples and a feedback-driven reward model, VeriReason combines testbench evaluations with structural heuristics while embedding self-checking capabilities for autonomous error correction. On the VerilogEval Benchmark, VeriReason delivers significant improvements: achieving 83.1% functional correctness on the VerilogEval Machine benchmark, substantially outperforming both comparable-sized models and much larger commercial systems like GPT-4 Turbo. Additionally, our approach demonstrates up to a 2.8X increase in first-attempt functional correctness compared to baseline methods and exhibits robust generalization to unseen designs. To our knowledge, VeriReason represents the first system to successfully integrate explicit reasoning capabilities with reinforcement learning for Verilog generation, establishing a new state-of-the-art for automated RTL synthesis.
