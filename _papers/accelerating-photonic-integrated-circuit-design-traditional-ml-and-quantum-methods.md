Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) provide superior speed, bandwidth, and energy efficiency, making them ideal for communication, sensing, and quantum computing applications. Despite their potential, PIC design workflows and integration lag behind those in electronics, calling for groundbreaking advancements. This review outlines the state of PIC design, comparing traditional simulation methods with machine learning approaches that enhance scalability and efficiency. It also explores the promise of quantum algorithms and quantum-inspired methods to address design challenges.
