The use of quantum annealers in black-box optimization to obtain the desired properties of a product with a small number of trials has attracted attention. However, the application of this technique to engineering design problems is still limited. Here, we demonstrate the applicability of black-box optimization with a quantum annealer to the design of electric circuit systems, focusing on $\pi$-type noise filters as an example. We develop a framework that uses quantum annealing to find the optimal location of electrical components and conductor paths connecting the components, and confirm that the learning process appropriately works over a number of trials to efficiently search for a design with high performance. The results show the potential applicability of quantum annealing to design problems of electric circuit systems.
