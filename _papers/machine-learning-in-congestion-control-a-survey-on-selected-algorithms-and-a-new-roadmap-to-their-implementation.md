With the emergence of new technologies, computer networks are becoming more structurally complex, diverse and heterogenous. The increasing discrepancy (among the interconnected networks) in data rates, delays, packet loss, and transmission scenarios, influence significantly the dynamics of congestion control (CC) parametrization. In contrast to the traditional endto-end CC algorithms that rely on strict rules, new approaches aim to involve machine learning in order to continuously adapt the CC to real-time network requirements. However, due to the high computational complexity and memory consumption, the feasibility of these schemes may still be questioned. This paper surveys selected machine-learning based approaches to CC and proposes a roadmap to their implementation in computer systems, by using dataflow computing and Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) chips.
