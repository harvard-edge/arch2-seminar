We present a deep learning approach using an optical neural network to predict the fundamental modal indices $n_{\rm{eff}}$ in a silicon (Si) channel waveguide. We use three inputs, e.g., two geometric parameters and one material property, and predict the $n_{\rm{eff}}$ for the transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarizations. With the least number (i.e., $3^3$ or $4^3$) of exact mode solutions from Maxwell's equations, we can uncover the solutions which correspond to $10^3$ numerical simulations. Note that this consumes the lowest amount of computational resources. The mean squared errors of the exact and the predicted results are $<10^{-5}$. Moreover, our parameters' ranges are compatible with current photolithography and complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication technology. We also show the impacts of different transfer functions and neural network layouts on the model's performance. Our approach presents a unique advantage to uncover the guided modes in any photonic waveguides within the least possible numerical simulations.
