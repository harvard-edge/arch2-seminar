Analog-on-Top Mixed Signal (AMS) Integrated Circuit (IC) design is a time-consuming process predominantly carried out by hand. Within this flow, usually, some area is reserved by the top-level integrator for the placement of digital blocks. Specific features of the area, such as size and shape, have a relevant impact on the possibility of implementing the digital logic with the required functionality. We present a Machine Learning (ML)-based evaluation methodology for predicting the feasibility of digital implementation using a set of high-level features. This approach aims to avoid time-consuming Place-and-Route trials, enabling rapid feedback between Digital and Analog Back-End designers during top-level placement.
