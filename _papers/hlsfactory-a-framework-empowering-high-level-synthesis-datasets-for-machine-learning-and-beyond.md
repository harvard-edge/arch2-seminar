Machine learning (ML) techniques have been applied to high-level synthesis (HLS) flows for quality-of-result (QoR) prediction and design space exploration (DSE). Nevertheless, the scarcity of accessible high-quality HLS datasets and the complexity of building such datasets present challenges. Existing datasets have limitations in terms of benchmark coverage, design space enumeration, vendor extensibility, or lack of reproducible and extensible software for dataset construction. Many works also lack user-friendly ways to add more designs, limiting wider adoption of such datasets. In response to these challenges, we introduce HLSFactory, a comprehensive framework designed to facilitate the curation and generation of high-quality HLS design datasets. HLSFactory has three main stages: 1) a design space expansion stage to elaborate single HLS designs into large design spaces using various optimization directives across multiple vendor tools, 2) a design synthesis stage to execute HLS and FPGA tool flows concurrently across designs, and 3) a data aggregation stage for extracting standardized data into packaged datasets for ML usage. This tripartite architecture ensures broad design space coverage via design space expansion and supports multiple vendor tools. Users can contribute to each stage with their own HLS designs and synthesis results and extend the framework itself with custom frontends and tool flows. We also include an initial set of built-in designs from common HLS benchmarks curated open-source HLS designs. We showcase the versatility and multi-functionality of our framework through seven case studies: I) ML model for QoR prediction; II) Design space sampling; III) Fine-grained parallelism backend speedup; IV) Targeting Intel's HLS flow; V) Adding new auxiliary designs; VI) Integrating published HLS data; VII) HLS tool version regression benchmarking.
