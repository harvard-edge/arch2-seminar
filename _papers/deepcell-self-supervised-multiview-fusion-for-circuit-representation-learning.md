We introduce DeepCell, a novel circuit representation learning framework that effectively integrates multiview information from both And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs) and Post-Mapping (PM) netlists. At its core, DeepCell employs a self-supervised Mask Circuit Modeling (MCM) strategy, inspired by masked language modeling, to fuse complementary circuit representations from different design stages into unified and rich embeddings. To our knowledge, DeepCell is the first framework explicitly designed for PM netlist representation learning, setting new benchmarks in both predictive accuracy and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate the practical efficacy of DeepCell by applying it to critical EDA tasks such as functional Engineering Change Orders (ECO) and technology mapping. Extensive experimental results show that DeepCell significantly surpasses state-of-the-art open-source EDA tools in efficiency and performance.
