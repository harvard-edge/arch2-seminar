In emerging high-performance Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures, efficient power management is crucial to minimize energy consumption. We propose a novel framework called CAFEEN that employs both heuristic-based fine-grained and machine learning-based coarse-grained power-gating for energy-efficient NoCs. CAFEEN uses a fine-grained method to activate only essential NoC buffers during lower network loads. It switches to a coarse-grained method at peak loads to minimize compounding wake-up overhead using multi-agent reinforcement learning. Results show that CAFEEN adaptively balances power-efficiency with performance, reducing total energy by 2.60x for single application workloads and 4.37x for multi-application workloads, compared to state-of-the-art NoC power-gating frameworks.
