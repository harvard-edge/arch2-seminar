While impressive progress has been already achieved in wide-bandgap (WBG) semicon-ductors such as 4H-SiC and GaN technologies, the lack of intelligent methodologies to control the gate drives prevented to the exploit the maximum potential of semiconductor chips, from obtaining the desired devices operations. Thus, a potent ongoing trend is to design a fast gate driver switching scheme to upgrade the performance of electronic equipment at the system level. To address this issue, this work proposes a novel intelligent scheme for the control of gate driver switching using the concept of quantum computation in machine learning. In particular, the quantum principle is incorporated into deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address the hardware limitations of con-ventional computers and the growing amount of data sets. Taking potential benefits of quantum theory, the DRL algorithm influenced by quantum specifications (referred to as QDRL) will not only ameliorate the performance of the native algorithm on traditional computers, but also enhance the progress of relevant research fields like quantum computing and machine learning. To test the prac-ticability and usefulness of QDRL, a dc/dc parallel boost converters feeding constant power loads (CPLs) is chosen as the case study, and several Power Hard-ware-in-the-loop (PHiL) experiments and comparative analysis are given.
