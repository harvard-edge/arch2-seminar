Obfuscation stands as a promising solution for safeguarding hardware intellectual property (IP) against a spectrum of threats including reverse engineering, IP piracy, and tampering. In this paper, we introduce Obfus-chat, a novel framework leveraging Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models to automate the obfuscation process. The proposed framework accepts hardware design netlists and key sizes as inputs, and autonomously generates obfuscated code tailored to enhance security. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we employ the Trust-Hub Obfuscation Benchmark for comparative analysis. We employed SAT attacks to assess the security of the design, along with functional verification procedures to ensure that the obfuscated design remains consistent with the original. Our results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed framework in fortifying hardware IP against potential threats, thus providing a valuable contribution to the field of hardware security.
