Approximate Computing (AxC) techniques have become increasingly popular in trading off accuracy for performance gains in various applications. Selecting the best AxC techniques for a given application is challenging. Among proposed approaches for exploring the design space, Machine Learning approaches such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) show promising results. In this paper, we proposed an RL-based multi-objective Design Space Exploration strategy to find the approximate versions of the application that balance accuracy degradation and power and computation time reduction. Our experimental results show a good trade-off between accuracy degradation and decreased power and computation time for some benchmarks.
