Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven electronic design automation (EDA) techniques have been extensively explored for VLSI circuit design applications. Most recently, foundation AI models for circuits have emerged as a new technology trend. Unlike traditional task-specific AI solutions, these new AI models are developed through two stages: 1) self-supervised pre-training on a large amount of unlabeled data to learn intrinsic circuit properties; and 2) efficient fine-tuning for specific downstream applications, such as early-stage design quality evaluation, circuit-related context generation, and functional verification. This new paradigm brings many advantages: model generalization, less reliance on labeled circuit data, efficient adaptation to new tasks, and unprecedented generative capability. In this paper, we propose referring to AI models developed with this new paradigm as circuit foundation models (CFMs). This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the latest progress in circuit foundation models, unprecedentedly covering over 130 relevant works. Over 90% of our introduced works were published in or after 2022, indicating that this emerging research trend has attracted wide attention in a short period. In this survey, we propose to categorize all existing circuit foundation models into two primary types: 1) encoder-based methods performing general circuit representation learning for predictive tasks; and 2) decoder-based methods leveraging large language models (LLMs) for generative tasks. For our introduced works, we cover their input modalities, model architecture, pre-training strategies, domain adaptation techniques, and downstream design applications. In addition, this paper discussed the unique properties of circuits from the data perspective. These circuit properties have motivated many works in this domain and differentiated them from general AI techniques.
