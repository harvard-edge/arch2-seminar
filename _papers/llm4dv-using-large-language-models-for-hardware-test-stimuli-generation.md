Hardware design verification (DV) is a process that checks the functional equivalence of a hardware design against its specifications, improving hardware reliability and robustness. A key task in the DV process is the test stimuli generation, which creates a set of conditions or inputs for testing. These test conditions are often complex and specific to the given hardware design, requiring substantial human engineering effort to optimize. We seek a solution of automated and efficient testing for arbitrary hardware designs that takes advantage of large language models (LLMs). LLMs have already shown promising results for improving hardware design automation, but remain under-explored for hardware DV. In this paper, we propose an open-source benchmarking framework named LLM4DV that efficiently orchestrates LLMs for automated hardware test stimuli generation. Our analysis evaluates six different LLMs involving six prompting improvements over eight hardware designs and provides insight for future work on LLMs development for efficient automated DV.
