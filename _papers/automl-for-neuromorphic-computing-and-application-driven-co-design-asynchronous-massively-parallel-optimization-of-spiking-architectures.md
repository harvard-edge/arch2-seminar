In this work we have extended AutoML inspired approaches to the exploration and optimization of neuromorphic architectures. Through the integration of a parallel asynchronous model-based search approach with a simulation framework to simulate spiking architectures, we are able to efficiently explore the configuration space of neuromorphic architectures and identify the subset of conditions leading to the highest performance in a targeted application. We have demonstrated this approach on an exemplar case of real time, on-chip learning application. Our results indicate that we can effectively use optimization approaches to optimize complex architectures, therefore providing a viable pathway towards application-driven codesign.
