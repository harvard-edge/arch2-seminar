Transistors are the basic building blocks for all electronics. Accurate prediction of their current-voltage (IV) characteristics enables circuit simulations before the expensive silicon tape-out. In this work, we propose using deep neural network to improve the accuracy for the conventional, physics-based compact model for nanoscale transistors. Physics-driven requirements on the neural network are discussed. Using finite element simulation as the input dataset, together with a neural network with roughly 30 neurons, the final IV model can well-predict the IV to within 1%. The trained model can readily be implemented by the hardware description language (HDL) such as VerilogA for circuit simulation.
