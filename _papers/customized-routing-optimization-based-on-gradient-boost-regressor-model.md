In this paper, we discussed limitation of current electronic-design-automoation (EDA) tool and proposed a machine learning framework to overcome the limitations and achieve better design quality. We explored how to efficiently extract relevant features and leverage gradient boost regressor (GBR) model to predict underestimated risky net (URN). Customized routing optimizations are applied to the URNs and results show clear timing improvement and trend to converge toward timing closure.
