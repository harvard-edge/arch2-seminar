Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have been increasingly used in several fields to improve performance and the level of automation. In recent years, this use has exponentially increased due to the advancement of high-performance computing and the ever increasing size of data. One of such fields is that of hardware design; specifically the design of digital and analog integrated circuits~(ICs), where AI/ ML techniques have been extensively used to address ever-increasing design complexity, aggressive time-to-market, and the growing number of ubiquitous interconnected devices (IoT). However, the security concerns and issues related to IC design have been highly overlooked. In this paper, we summarize the state-of-the-art in AL/ML for circuit design/optimization, security and engineering challenges, research in security-aware CAD/EDA, and future research directions and needs for using AI/ML for security-aware circuit design.
