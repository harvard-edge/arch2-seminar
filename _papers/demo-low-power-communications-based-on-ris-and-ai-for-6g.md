Ultra-massive multiple-input-multiple-output (UM-MIMO) is promising to meet the high rate requirements for future 6G. However, due to the large number of antennas and high path loss, the hardware power consumption and computing power consumption of UM-MIMO will be unaffordable. To address this problem, we implement a low-power communication system based on reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and artificial intelligence (AI) for 6G. For hardware design, we employ a 256-element RIS at the base station to replace the traditional phased array. Moreover, a 2304-element RIS is developed as a relay to assist communication with much reduced transmit power. For software implementation, we develop an AI-based transmission design to reduce computing power consumption. By jointly designing the hardware and software, this prototype can realize real-time 4K video transmission with much reduced power consumption.
