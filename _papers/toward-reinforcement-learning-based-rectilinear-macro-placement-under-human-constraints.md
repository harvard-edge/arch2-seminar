Macro placement is a critical phase in chip design, which becomes more intricate when involving general rectilinear macros and layout areas. Furthermore, macro placement that incorporates human-like constraints, such as design hierarchy and peripheral bias, has the potential to significantly reduce the amount of additional manual labor required from designers. This study proposes a methodology that leverages an approach suggested by Google's Circuit Training (G-CT) to provide a learning-based macro placer that not only supports placing rectilinear cases, but also adheres to crucial human-like design principles. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in achieving power-performance-area (PPA) metrics and in obtaining placements of high quality, comparable to those produced with human intervention. Additionally, our methodology shows potential as a generalized model to address diverse macro shapes and layout areas.
