Our aim for the ML Contest for Chip Design with HLS 2024 was to predict the validity, running latency in the form of cycle counts, utilization rate of BRAM (util-BRAM), utilization rate of lookup tables (uti-LUT), utilization rate of flip flops (util-FF), and the utilization rate of digital signal processors (util-DSP). We used Chain-of-thought techniques with large language models to perform classification and regression tasks. Our prediction is that with larger models reasoning was much improved. We release our prompts and propose a HLS benchmarking task for LLMs.
