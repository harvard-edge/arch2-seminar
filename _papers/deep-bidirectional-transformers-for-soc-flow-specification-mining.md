High-quality system-level message flow specifications can lead to comprehensive validation of system-on-chip (SoC) designs. We propose a disruptive method that utilizes an attention mechanism to produce accurate flow specifications from SoC IP communication traces. The proposed method can overcome the inherent complexity of SoC traces induced by the concurrency and parallelism of multicore designs that existing flow specification mining tools often find extremely challenging. Experiments on highly interleaved traces show promising flow reconstruction compared to several tools dedicated to the flow specification mining problem.
