Chip placement has been one of the most time consuming task in any semi conductor area, Due to this negligence, many projects are pushed and chips availability in real markets get delayed. An engineer placing macros on a chip also needs to place it optimally to reduce the three important factors like power, performance and time. Looking at these prior problems we wanted to introduce a new method using Reinforcement Learning where we train the model to place the nodes of a chip netlist onto a chip canvas. We want to build a neural architecture that will accurately reward the agent across a wide variety of input netlist correctly.
