This paper introduces Natural-Level Synthesis, an innovative approach for generating hardware using generative artificial intelligence on both the system level and component-level. NLS bridges a gap in current hardware development processes, where algorithm and application engineers' involvement typically ends at the requirements stage. With NLS, engineers can participate more deeply in the development, synthesis, and test stages by using Gen-AI models to convert natural language descriptions directly into Hardware Description Language code. This approach not only streamlines hardware development but also improves accessibility, fostering a collaborative workflow between hardware and algorithm engineers. We developed the NLS tool to facilitate natural language-driven HDL synthesis, enabling rapid generation of system-level HDL designs while significantly reducing development complexity. Evaluated through case studies and benchmarks using Performance, Power, and Area metrics, NLS shows its potential to enhance resource efficiency in hardware development. This work provides a extensible, efficient solution for hardware synthesis and establishes a Visual Studio Code Extension to assess Gen-AI-driven HDL generation and system integration, laying a foundation for future AI-enhanced and AI-in-the-loop Electronic Design Automation tools.
