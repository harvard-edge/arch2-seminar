Net length is a key proxy metric for optimizing timing and power across various stages of a standard digital design flow. However, the bulk of net length information is not available until cell placement, and hence it is a significant challenge to explicitly consider net length optimization in design stages prior to placement, such as logic synthesis. This work addresses this challenge by proposing a graph attention network method with customization, called Net2, to estimate individual net length before cell placement. Its accuracy-oriented version Net2a achieves about 15% better accuracy than several previous works in identifying both long nets and long critical paths. Its fast version Net2f is more than 1000 times faster than placement while still outperforms previous works and other neural network techniques in terms of various accuracy metrics.
